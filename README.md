# ML_Graph_Interpreter

This is the model used for the [Benetech-Making Graphs Accessible](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/benetech-making-graphs-accessible/overview) Kaggle Competition. This model consists of a 2-stage pipeline that trains a Convolutional Neural Network to classify graphs and a pre-trained model (google deplot) to do data inference, resulting in the elimination of the need for most manual graph-to-dataset conversions.

## For UCSC CSE-144, with the help of Kai Hay, Sion Daniel, Will Hord, and Qingmei Chen.
